This project comprises four DNA bases and generates an array containing 15 bases, after that it simulates P. aequorâ€˜s high rate of mutation and compares the DNA sequences of different P. aequor.

## Description

* TA team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. This program creates objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for a research team to study.
* This project was developed in JavaScript.
